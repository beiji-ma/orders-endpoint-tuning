# Caching Is Not a Query Strategy: A Critique of Redis-Centric Thinking

When performance issues surface in a system, developers often reach for caching â€” and Redis is the go-to. Itâ€™s fast, in-memory, distributed, and battle-tested. But is it *right*?

This chapter is not a condemnation of Redis as a tool. It is a critique of **how caching is misused to paper over structural problems**, and how ORMs like JPA encourage that misuse.

## 1. TTL Is Not a Consistency Model

Redis keys expire. That's how TTL works. But does your data model?

Business entities donâ€™t age like bananas. Product catalogs, user profiles, order statuses â€” their lifecycle is governed by domain events, not seconds. A blanket TTL is an arbitrary expiration imposed on structured data, often without understanding when or why the data becomes invalid.

> "Cache it for 10 minutes" is not a strategy. Itâ€™s a deferral of thought.

## 2. Lazy Fetching + Caching = ðŸ’£

Consider a JPA entity with lazy-loaded associations. You serialize it into cache. Later, someone fetches itâ€¦ but the session is gone, the persistence context is detached, and boom:

```
org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy - no Session
```

To avoid this, developers either overfetch (defeating the point of lazy) or use DTOs. But then the cache becomes a quasi-copy of the database â€” without joins, constraints, or even awareness of what's stale.

## 3. Redis Isnâ€™t a Structure-Aware Store

Caching a user profile? Great. Caching a nested tree of orders, items, and metadata? Redis doesnâ€™t know the shape of what it holds. Thereâ€™s no way to invalidate partial graphs, or even observe which parts of the structure are hot.

This forces developers into brittle key-naming schemes, ad hoc invalidation logic, and massive cache busts.

## 4. But Everyone Uses It?

Yes. But popularity is not validation.

We argue that caching, when used as a primary access path, **masks architectural deficiencies**:

- Poor index design
- Lack of query structure control
- ORM opacity

## 5. What Oracle Knows That We Forgot

Oracle, InnoDB, and similar engines maintain **memory-first structures** â€” dictionary caches, library caches, shared plans. They donâ€™t shove data into Redis. They design their *own* structure-aware memory layout.

> In other words: they donâ€™t cache queries. They **design memory as part of access.**

## 6. What We Propose

If caching is needed, it should be:

- **Model-aligned**: reflect structural boundaries and entity lifecycles
- **Observable**: show hit/miss with shape awareness
- **Optional**: not mandatory for system correctness
- **Smart**: invalidated by cause, not time

And most importantly:

> Caching should be **adjacent** to your access strategy, not a substitute for it.

In the chapters ahead, we will present an architecture where cache is not a band-aid, but a conscious layer â€” shaped by query structure and lifecycle semantics.
