# Appendix: Rootless Roots â€” Architectural Koans of MMSA (English)

> The architect does not rush.  
> Slower than a patch, quicker than regret.  
> They grasp not at tech, cling not to fixes.  
> They perceive shape, trace access, and guard structure.

### ðŸª· 1. Before Structure, All Is Suffering

A developer asked: Why is my query so slow?  
The master answered: Because you never knew what you truly wanted.  
You fetched every field but showed only one.  
You feared lazy loading, yet never named your fetch shape.  

Without structure, how can you master speed?

### ðŸª· 2. Cache Is a Bandage, Structure Is the Medicine

Caching is a fig leaf, hiding your modeling shame.  
You cached the result, but ignored the path.  

To rely on Redis is like floating on wood â€”  
It may carry you, or it may sink.  

Those who see structure have no fear of cache misses.

### ðŸª· 3. The Way of JPA: Half-Truths and Illusions

ORMs walk beside you like a shadow.  
They map data, but never reveal the path.  
They write SQL, but suppress your intent.  

To trust ORM fully is to be trapped in appearances.  

To know its limits, and choose otherwise â€” that is the first gate of MMSA.

### ðŸª· 4. The Art of Stability Lies in Needing No Fix

A stable system does not slow with scale, nor break with growth.  
It chases not versatility but clarity.  

Its core is threefold:  
- Structure  
- Access  
- Observability  

With these, why fear change?

### ðŸª· 5. DSL: The Many Made One

Too many hands, too many formats â€” entropy follows.  
APIs grow bloated. Docs multiply.  

Only language unifies intent.  
Only syntax captures shape.  

With a DSL, the path persists.  
This is the return to source â€” the heart of MMSA.
