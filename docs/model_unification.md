# One Model Everywhere: Querying Memory Like B-Trees

## 1. The Model Is the Interface

We often separate database code from application logic. ORM here, repository there, cache in the corner. But under the hood, they all speak the same thing:

> Objects, structures, relationships — a *model*.

What if that model could be **shared**, structurally, across layers?

- Queried in SQL at rest
- Queried in-memory during runtime
- Queried across the wire via RPC or GraphQL

We call this: **One Model, Many Runtimes**.

## 2. The MatrixOne Insight: Memory Is Just Storage with Intent

MatrixOne’s B-Tree engine taught us something subtle:

> You don’t query *data*. You traverse *intentional structure*.

Its layout:

- Reflects data access paths (e.g. OID trees)
- Is consistent across inserts, reads, joins
- Encodes a stable, observable structure

If such a layout exists for disk… why not for memory?

## 3. DSL Should Not Care Where

A real fetch expression DSL must be portable.

It should work:

- Over SQL (via translation)
- Over in-memory lists and maps
- Over nested objects in a service layer

As long as the structure is queryable, the DSL stays the same.

Examples:

```dsl
fetch orders where status = "OPEN" limit 50
```

Should compile to:

- SQL
- Java Stream filter + sort
- REST layer slice query

## 4. Querying JVM Like a B-Tree

Imagine:

```java
List<Order> orders = inMemoryStore.query(
    dsl("orders where created_at > :t order by id limit 100"));
```

- Backed by sorted list, index map, or lazy join structure
- Uses same fetch DSL as DB layer
- Can cache partial plans or push to async fetcher

This makes observability and performance portable:

- DSL becomes query log
- Memory pressure becomes index scan issue
- GC and cursor pressure become measurable

---

## 5. Structure Is the Real Optimization

When we talk about performance, we often mean:

- Avoiding joins
- Reducing overfetching
- Localizing data shape

But all of that is just:

> **Using the right structure**

And if our structure is shared across memory, DB, and network — Then performance is just a property of design.

Not an accident. Not a patch. Not a miracle.

Just structure, everywhere.
