# ORM Can’t Save You: The Myth of Mapping as Access

In the heart of ORM-based architectures lies a fragile promise: that a mapping from objects to tables also defines how you should fetch data. This assumption has shaped frameworks like Hibernate, JPA, and countless application layers built atop them. But it is also the silent reason why performance decays, why observability vanishes, and why developers find themselves debugging generated SQLs rather than designing explicit access paths.

## The Inflexible Plan

JPA encourages developers to define relationships declaratively — via annotations like `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, and fetch modes like `EAGER` and `LAZY`. But these directives are static. They embed structural assumptions into the model itself, instead of separating *what* the data means from *how* we should retrieve it.

> You can’t change access paths at runtime. You can’t express shape-dependent fetch strategies. You can’t reason about cost. The access path is baked in.

When performance problems arise, developers scramble to annotate more, refactor fetch joins, and switch between EntityGraphs and DTO projections. But these are reactionary, not architectural.

## No Observability, No Plan

The second sin of ORM access is that you can’t *see* it.

The query plan that emerges from a method like `findAll()` is buried inside a query generator, abstracted by proxies and hidden from logs. There’s no shape, no visibility, and no way to map cause to effect. Developers debug SQL the framework wrote on their behalf.

This is not observability. It is opacity masquerading as productivity.

## Access ≠ Mapping

We must separate the concern of structure (model) from the concern of access (query). ORM entangles both:

- You define a field as `List<Order>` and you’re stuck with join strategies.
- You use `@Fetch(FetchMode.JOIN)` and you’re tied to the N+1 problem.
- You introduce `@EntityGraph` and start navigating trees of hints.

In this design, you don’t control the access path — you *hope* the framework picks something reasonable.

## Towards Explicit Access

An ideal access path mechanism should be:

- **Programmable**: composable at runtime based on use case
- **Observable**: transparently loggable with structure shape
- **Testable**: verifiable in isolation, not buried in annotations
- **Separable**: defined apart from the data model itself

This is why we argue: ORM is a mapping tool, not an access engine. And modern systems demand the latter.

## What We Propose

Instead of manipulating mappings to control performance, we propose **designing access as a first-class concern** — via:

- Structure-aware DSLs
- ID-first (OID) based graph navigations
- Explicit shape-driven query interfaces

In the chapters ahead, we will demonstrate how this separation of concerns leads to more scalable, observable, and maintainable systems.

Because real systems don’t just persist data. They traverse structure.
