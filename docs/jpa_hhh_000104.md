# Paging vs. Fetching: Why JPA Crumbles

## 1. The Warning We All Ignored

If you’ve ever used JPA with pagination and fetch joins, you’ve likely seen this warning:

```text
HHH000104: firstResult/maxResults specified with collection fetch; applying in memory!
```

Hibernate is trying to be helpful. It’s telling you that pagination **won’t happen in the database**. Instead, it will load all rows into memory, then slice the result in Java.

This sounds bad. And it is.

But most developers treat this like background noise. Because:

- The code still “works”
- The error doesn’t crash anything
- The system is still returning pages… for now

Until one day, it isn’t.

## 2. How Things Went Sideways

In our case, everything seemed fine—until the number of `OrderEntity` records reached a critical threshold. Then, something snapped:

- Cursor count exploded: from **a few dozen** to **over 50,000**
- API latency spiked, sometimes exceeding 5 seconds
- Memory pressure triggered GC pauses
- Users began reporting random timeouts and “data disappears” bugs

And it all traced back to one thing: a `@OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)` association being overridden by a fetch join in a paginated query.

Hibernate warned us. We didn’t listen. Now we were paying the price.

## 3. Why ORM Can’t Fix This

This isn’t a Hibernate bug. It’s a consequence of trying to express relational algebra through a framework that never exposes the plan.

In SQL, pagination is part of the query plan. It defines what slice of the result set to return—**after** the joins, filters, projections, and sort orders are considered.

But JPA doesn’t deal in plans. It deals in objects.

- It encourages developers to write queries in terms of entities.
- It auto-generates joins based on annotations.
- It hides the physical query plan from the developer.

So when a fetch join inflates a `@OneToMany` into multiple rows, and pagination applies afterward, it’s already too late. The ORM doesn't “see” the join explosion—it just flattens and slices.

This is why Hibernate warns you. It knows the join has broken the pagination semantics. But it can’t fix it. Because the query plan is implicit.

## 4. Paging Is a Relational Concept, Not a Trick

In relational algebra, pagination is a **projection + limit** operation. It must apply to a well-defined set.

But fetch joins destroy that set. They create **row duplication**, inflating the cardinality of the result. This breaks the assumptions of pagination:

- You think you’re paginating 50 orders
- You’re actually paginating 350 rows—7 tags per order
- Your offset/page boundary is meaningless now

The real fix isn’t clever query rewriting. It’s architectural:

- First, paginate over a primary entity (e.g., `OrderEntity`) **without joins**
- Then, in a second query, load associated data for those IDs only

This two-step approach restores relational semantics. It lets the database optimize each phase. And it gives you back control.

ORMs can’t do this automatically. But we can.

## 5. Looking Ahead

This incident forced us to re-think our API strategy.

Instead of letting JPA infer how to hydrate entities, we began to **treat access patterns as first-class citizens**. Pagination, association loading, and filtering became structured steps—not annotations or side effects.

This led to our first prototype of **two-step fetching**—a method that splits entity access into discrete, composable operations.

We’ll cover that in the next article.

> For now, remember: if you’re paginating with fetch joins, you’re not paginating. You’re gambling.
